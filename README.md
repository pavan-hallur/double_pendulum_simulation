# double_pendulum_simulation
The physical motion of systems of rigid bodies is modeled in terms of the equations of motion. These are
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in time. The temporal evolution of such systems can be obtained by
integration in time.
Coupled systems can easily become non-linear. Such non-linear systems can lead to deterministic chaos.
That means, that a small variation in the initial conditions leads to completely different solutions after some
time.
A well known example for such a system in the non-linear double pendulum. In this project numerical solver is implemented to compute the temporal evolution on the double pendulum.
